# Introduction


## Problem Statement

Clearly define the problem statement that your chosen feature aims to address.

## Implementation

You should make your modifications in either the `HouseElevation` or `ParkingGarage` module.
Detail the steps taken to implement the selected feature and integrate it into the decision-support tool.
Include code snippets and explanations where necessary to clarify the implementation process.

## Validation

As we have seen in labs, mistakes are inevitable and can lead to misleading results.
To minimize the risk of errors making their way into final results, it is essential to validate the implemented feature.
Describe the validation techniques used to ensure the accuracy and reliability of your implemented feature.
Discuss any challenges faced during the validation process and how they were addressed.

# Results

Present the results obtained from the enhanced decision-support tool.
Use tables, figures, and visualizations to clearly communicate the outcomes.
Provide sufficient detail to demonstrate how the implemented feature addresses the problem statement.
Use the `#| output: false` and/or `#| echo: false` tags to hide code output and code cells in the final report except where showing the output (e.g.g, a plot) or the code (e.g., how you are sampling SOWs) adds value to the discussion.
You may have multiple subsections of results, which you can create using `##`.

# Conclusions

## Discussion

Analyze the implications of your results for climate risk management.
Consider the context of the class themes and discuss how your findings contribute to the understanding of climate risk assessment.
Identify any limitations of your approach and suggest potential improvements for future work.

## Conclusions

Summarize the key findings of your project and reiterate the significance of your implemented feature in addressing the problem statement.
Discuss the broader implications of your work for climate risk management and the potential for further research in this area.
